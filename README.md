# Azure-CSP-to-EA-and-CSP-to-CSP-Migration
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the migration process from Azure Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) to Enterprise Agreement (EA) and from CSP to CSP.

## CSP To CSP
When moving your Azure CSP (Cloud Solution Provider) relationship from one partner to another, you typically don't need to migrate your Azure services to a new subscription. The change primarily involves transferring the management and billing responsibilities from one CSP partner to another while retaining your existing Azure subscription and resources.
# Subscription Retention:
Your Azure subscription remains the same; there's no need to create a new subscription.
The transition involves updating the CSP partner associated with your existing subscription.

# Partner and Contract Change:
The primary changes occur at the partner and contractual levels.
You switch from one CSP partner to another, and the contractual relationship with the new partner is established.

# Billing and Management:
The new CSP partner will take over billing and management responsibilities for your existing Azure subscription.
The Azure resources and configurations within your subscription remain unchanged.

# Communication and Coordination:
Effective communication between the current and new CSP partners is crucial to ensure a smooth transition.
The new CSP partner needs access and relevant information to manage your existing Azure services seamlessly.

# Documentation and Access:
Ensure that all necessary documentation, access credentials, and relevant information about your Azure environment are provided to the new CSP partner.
